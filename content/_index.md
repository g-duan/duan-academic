      title: 'ðŸ“š My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        My research interests include urban micrometeorology, atmospheric air pollution and turbulence-resolving numerical modelling. I remain particularly interested in the fundamental aspects underlying the complex interaction of bluff body with fluids in general, and engineering-environmental fluid dynamics and boundary-layer turbulence in particular.

        I have been enthusiastic about research topics, including 1) urban wind hazards and overheating; 2) outdoor ventilation under complex micrometeorological forcing; 3) air pollution exposure and environmental sustainability; and 4) downscaling of mesoscale perturbations into building-resolving large-eddy simulation (LES), aiming to address critical questions related to urban climate and microenvironments, which attract increasing concerns in the academic community amidst the significant changes brought by global climate change.
