  abstract = {Ventilation has shown strong sensitivity to urban geometrical heterogeneity; however, the quantitative connection with the urban morphometric indices, e.g. the packing densities (λf and λp for the frontal and plan area, respectively) and the building-height variability (σH), remains unclear. Using large-eddy simulation (LES), the dispersion of a pollutant scalar is investigated for turbulent boundary-layer (TBL) flows developed over real urban regions. While the time history of the domain averaged concentrations follow the familiar exponentially decaying function for all cases, the decay rates differ and there is a clear monotonic dependence on λf. The mean tracer age, τa, exhibits a strong linear scaling with λf as well (R2=0.8); however, an unambiguous relationship is hard to be discerned for the ventilation timescales versus the other morphometric indices (e.g. λp and σH). An effective canyon aspect ratio (AReff) is proposed for real urban districts, which allows ventilation to be quantified in a simpler manner as that for idealised canyons. The age spectrum, which measures the probability density function of tracer ages across multiple timescales, is analysed to reveal the mechanisms underlying the well-defined connection between ventilation and λf. Results are compared with that for an aligned building array of an equivalent canyon aspect ratio to AReff. The departures reflect the nonlinear effects that are not captured in idealised urban topography setups. The results could be useful for the parameterisation of ventilation in urban areas of complex geometrical profiles and may serve as a reference for urban layout design towards optimum active ventilation capability.},

  abstract = {Pollutant exposure in the urban air quality literature has been typically interpreted from data for fixed locations, which provides an incomplete picture of exposure for pedestrians (or moving receptors). The current study proposes a simple model to parameterise the exposure time for a virtual walker to cross a pollutant cloud during its sweeping downstream across the avenue. The parameterisation, which depends on the centre-of-mass translation and the cloud size, shows satisfactory performance in areas away from the outlet, whence a substantial portion of the pollutants is removed from the control domain and a well-defined centre of mass geometrically vanishes. Applying the tracer age diagnostics, the occurrence time of first exposure for the moving receptors is quantified with no particular caution required for the outlet region. The mean tracer age recorded by the virtual walkers is shown to be up to 25%–75% smaller than conventional spatial averages, implying earlier exposure to the pollutants and hence a reference timescale relying on the latter may lead to delayed emergency response. Evacuation route prioritisation based on virtual walker measurements coincides with that indicated by the parameterisation, suggesting the potential usefulness of the model for exposure risk evaluation against atmospheric air pollution incidents.},
