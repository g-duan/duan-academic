abstract: Strategic vegetation placement can significantly alter airflow patterns
  and turbulence, fostering desired wind environments. By comparing scenarios where
  vegetation is placed upstream, downstream or absent (treeless) relative to a single
  building using large-eddy simulation, this study provides detailed insights into
  the sensitivity of flow dynamics to the positioning of the vegetation. Upstream
  vegetation more significantly disrupts the flow patterns around the building obstacle,
  altering vertical wind profiles and modifying wake circulations, compared to downstream
  vegetation. A small shear layer developed at the plant top for upstream vegetation
  markedly influences turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) on both the leeward and windward
  sides of the building, shifting the inflection point in vertical TKE profiles by
  up to  0.13H. By contrast, smaller tree-building separations lead to an effective
  merging of their aerodynamic profiles, whereas larger separations confine the streamwise
  breadth of turbulent fluxes, amplifying flux exchanges in the spanwise direction.
  Spectral analyses reveal that upstream vegetation consistently results in higher
  power spectral densities of the streamwise turbulence in the residential area than
  downstream vegetation. While small-scale spanwise velocity fluctuations are found
  to be comparably energetic at the building's windward side for upstream vegetation,
  the power becomes substantially concentrated on large-scale eddies in the building
  wake region, providing specific insights into modulating turbulent eddy motions
  within the residential zone.
