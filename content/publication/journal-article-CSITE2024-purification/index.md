abstract: Industrial gases must undergo purification to meet discharge or product standards. While the internal trays of a scrubber tower (ST) are often geometrically complex, it is possible that a simpler design with improved permeability could achieve satisfactory washing performance. Herein, the downward-flowing washing liquid and upward-rising gas inside a simplified ST, built based on the ST equipment of a Shale Oil Refinery factory, was evaluated for different tray arrangements.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
