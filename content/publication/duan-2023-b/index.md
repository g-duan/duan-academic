abstract: Pollutant exposure in the urban air quality literature has been typically
  interpreted from data for fixed locations, which provides an incomplete picture
  of exposure for pedestrians (or moving receptors). The current study proposes a
  simple model to parameterise the exposure time for a virtual walker to cross a pollutant
  cloud during its sweeping downstream across the avenue. The parameterisation, which
  depends on the centre-of-mass translation and the cloud size, shows satisfactory
  performance in areas away from the outlet, whence a substantial portion of the pollutants
  is removed from the control domain and a well-defined centre of mass geometrically
  vanishes. Applying the tracer age diagnostics, the occurrence time of first exposure
  for the moving receptors is quantified with no particular caution required for the
  outlet region. The mean tracer age recorded by the virtual walkers is shown to be
  up to 25%â€“75% smaller than conventional spatial averages, implying earlier exposure
  to the pollutants and hence a reference timescale relying on the latter may lead
  to delayed emergency response. Evacuation route prioritisation based on virtual
  walker measurements coincides with that indicated by the parameterisation, suggesting
  the potential usefulness of the model for exposure risk evaluation against atmospheric
  air pollution incidents.
