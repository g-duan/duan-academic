abstract: The mean flow and turbulence within a regular building array are analysed
  for a wide range of bulk Richardson numbers, Rb, using large-eddy simulation. Time-averaged
  streamlines in the vertical plane reveal that skimming flow persists for stable
  and neutral conditions; for unstable conditions, however, updrafts dominate and
  the counter-rotating vortex pairs in the horizontal plane are displaced towards
  the leeward wall. The turbulent kinetic energy, magnitude of the turbulent shear
  stress and mean streamwise flow speed show a sharp transition at Rb=0. Quadrant
  analysis, in particular the fractional stress ratio, indicates that small fluctuations
  are generated most effectively by neutral flow and large ones by unstable flow.
  Identical-twin experiments confirm that the effects of stratification are large
  (pointwise errors in the relative kinetic energy are up to a factor of 10 larger
  for unstable flow). Knowledge of the flow-regime transition at Rb=0 is relevant
  to urban modelling and parameterisation.
