abstract: 'Industrial gases must undergo purification to meet discharge or product
  standards. While the internal trays of a scrubber tower (ST) are often geometrically
  complex, it is possible that a simpler design with improved permeability could achieve
  satisfactory washing performance. Herein, the downward-flowing washing liquid and
  upward-rising gas inside a simplified ST, built based on the ST equipment of a Shale
  Oil Refinery factory, was evaluated for different tray arrangements: α=15°, 30°
  and 45°, where α measures the misalignment between the angle steel strips of neighboring
  tray layers. The initial high velocity variance present in the lower part of the
  tower rapidly decreases as the gas ascends across the trays, markedly for the 45°
  alignment, revealing an enhanced mixing of the gas with the washing liquid. Slightly
  below the gas outlet, the mean pressure and temperature for the 45° configuration
  were found to be 14% and 10K lower, respectively, than the α=15° setup, implying
  that the former allows a more intensified gas–liquid heat exchange and ensures a
  more preferable gas pressure for discharge. The insights gained from these findings
  are anticipated to provide valuable guidance for streamlining the tray design without
  compromising the desired gas purification performance.'
