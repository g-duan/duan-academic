abstract: Urban flow and turbulence are driven by atmospheric flows with larger horizontal
  scales. Since building-resolving computational fluid dynamics models typically employ
  steady Dirichlet boundary conditions or forcing, the accuracy of numerical simulations
  may be limited by the neglect of perturbations. We investigate the sensitivity of
  flow within a unit-aspect-ratio street canyon to time-dependent perturbations near
  the inflow boundary. Using large-eddy simulation, time-periodic perturbations to
  the streamwise velocity component are incorporated via the nudging technique. Spatial
  averages of pointwise differences between unperturbed and perturbed velocity fields
  (i.e., the error kinetic energy) show a clear dependence on the perturbation period,
  though spatial structures are largely insensitive to the time-dependent forcing.
  The response of the error kinetic energy is maximized for perturbation periods comparable
  to the time scale of the mean canyon circulation. Frequency spectra indicate that
  this behaviour arises from a resonance between the inflow forcing and the mean motion
  around closed streamlines. The robustness of the results is confirmed using perturbations
  derived from measurements of roof-level wind speed.
