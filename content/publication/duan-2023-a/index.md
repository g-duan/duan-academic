abstract: Urban air quality studies have primarily focused on pollutant dispersion;
  however, spatial or temporal concentrations collected at discretely distributed
  grid points (or fixed receptors) do not reflect the actual pollutant exposure of
  pedestrians. Using large-eddy simulation (LES) with virtual walkers implemented,
  this study investigates pollutant exposure of walking agents (or moving receptors)
  in an urban turbulent boundary-layer flow developed over an aligned building array
  under the influence of different wind directions. The spatial variability of the
  exposure risks are found to be better captured by the moving receptors than the
  fixed receptors along the same agent walking tracks. We demonstrate that the actual
  exposure can differ significantly from results interpreted from data recorded by
  the fixed receptors (corresponding to Eulerian estimates) and show that large discrepancies
  occur in avenues near the source, wherein dispersion of the point release has not
  occurred on larger spatiotemporal scales. In most scenarios, optimal evacuation
  routes are shown to be ones that deviate as much as possible from the dominant wind
  direction; however, one needs to decide the priority of moving to further avenues
  first or immediately adjusting the walking direction. The results should serve as
  a useful baseline reference for environmental health impact assessment and evacuation
  route planning against hazardous releases of air pollutants in more complex urban
  environments.
