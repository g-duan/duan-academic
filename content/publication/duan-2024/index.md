abstract: Turbulent flow and boundary-layer (BL) characteristics over cylindrical
  obstacles have been understudied compared to the flow dynamics around cubic roughness
  in the urban BL literature. Using large-eddy simulation, we investigate a turbulent
  BL flow developed over two vertically oriented cylindrical obstacles aligned downstream.
  For widely separated cylinders, the wake flow undergoes periodic oscillations akin
  to vortex shedding behind an isolated cylinder. As the height-to-width aspect ratio
  (AR) of the canyon bounded by the cylinders increases, the streamline geometry exhibits
  a clear transition from isolated to wake interference and skimming regimes. Two-point
  autocorrelation functions of velocities confirm a strong coupling of canyon flow
  with the roughness sublayer for wider canyons, while with evident decoupling as
  the canyon narrows. The length scales, which measure the spatial correlation in
  the flow, decrease in both lateral and vertical directions with increasing AR. Turbulent
  kinetic energy and momentum fluxes below the roughness sublayer present pronounced
  monotonic scaling with AR (with R-squared values up to 0.84 and 0.98, respectively),
  resulting in a consistent variation in the surface roughness aerodynamic parameters,
  the roughness length (z0) and zero-plane displacement (d), with AR. Quantitative
  differences in the results with respect to those well-established for street canyons
  are analyzed, with the similarities highlighted. The results offer insights into
  boundary-layer flow parameterization concerning cylinder-occupied surface roughness.
