abstract: Abstract The influence of an elevated walkway on turbulent flow and dispersion
  inside a street canyon is investigated numerically with large-eddy simulation (LES).
  Different walkway designs and elevations are examined for a unit-aspect-ratio street
  canyon and an external wind perpendicular to the canyon axis. In place of a principal
  vortex extending through the canyon, smaller primary vortices appear above the walkway
  lid or below the walkway deck, in accord with the effective aspect ratio of the
  upper and lower regions. The mean flow decelerates below the deck and the turbulence
  kinetic energy (TKE) increases around the walkway structure for all configurations.
  Ventilation mechanisms for a pollutant emitted by a ground-level area source are
  qualitatively altered. Consequently mean concentrations at the pedestrian and walkway
  levels may increase by up to 20% and 30%, respectively. The velocity and pollutant
  statistics show a complicated dependence on the walkway design; this dependence
  is determined in part by interactions between the mean flow and turbulence.
