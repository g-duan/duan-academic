 abstract = {Strategic vegetation placement can significantly alter airflow patterns and turbulence, fostering desired wind environments. By comparing scenarios where vegetation is placed upstream, downstream or absent (treeless) relative to a single building using large-eddy simulation, this study provides detailed insights into the sensitivity of flow dynamics to the positioning of the vegetation. Upstream vegetation more significantly disrupts the flow patterns around the building obstacle, altering vertical wind profiles and modifying wake circulations, compared to downstream vegetation. A small shear layer developed at the plant top for upstream vegetation markedly influences turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) on both the leeward and windward sides of the building, shifting the inflection point in vertical TKE profiles by up to  0.13H. By contrast, smaller tree-building separations lead to an effective merging of their aerodynamic profiles, whereas larger separations confine the streamwise breadth of turbulent fluxes, amplifying flux exchanges in the spanwise direction. Spectral analyses reveal that upstream vegetation consistently results in higher power spectral densities of the streamwise turbulence in the residential area than downstream vegetation. While small-scale spanwise velocity fluctuations are found to be comparably energetic at the building's windward side for upstream vegetation, the power becomes substantially concentrated on large-scale eddies in the building wake region, providing specific insights into modulating turbulent eddy motions within the residential zone.},
