abstract: 'The scalar dynamics within a unit-aspect-ratio street canyon are studied
  using large-eddy simulation. The key processes of ventilation and mixing are analysed
  with the canyon-averaged concentration, mean tracer age and variance. The results
  are sensitive to the source location and can be classified according to the streamline
  geometry. The canyon-averaged concentrations for the corner vortices, vortex sea
  and central vortex do not converge to the same value at large times, though the
  mean decay rates do. The variance measured with respect to the canyon average shows
  two distinct decay regimes: the early regime reflects large-scale straining and
  enhanced diffusion across streamlines, while the late regime is associated with
  escape from the canyon, i.e., ventilation. Analytical predictions for the variance-decay
  or mixing time scales are verified for the early regime. It is argued that the presence
  of an open boundary at the roof level suppresses rapid mixing of the scalar field
  and is responsible for differences with respect to scalar dynamics within closed
  domains.'
