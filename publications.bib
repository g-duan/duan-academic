  abstract = {{Strategic vegetation placement can significantly alter airflow patterns and turbulence, fostering desired wind environments. By comparing scenarios where vegetation is placed upstream, downstream or absent (treeless) relative to a single building using large-eddy simulation, this study provides detailed insights into the sensitivity of flow dynamics to the positioning of the vegetation. Upstream vegetation more significantly disrupts the flow patterns around the building obstacle, altering vertical wind profiles and modifying wake circulations, compared to downstream vegetation. A small shear layer developed at the plant top for upstream vegetation markedly influences turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) on both the leeward and windward sides of the building, shifting the inflection point in vertical TKE profiles by up to  0.13H. By contrast, smaller tree-building separations lead to an effective merging of their aerodynamic profiles, whereas larger separations confine the streamwise breadth of turbulent fluxes, amplifying flux exchanges in the spanwise direction. Spectral analyses reveal that upstream vegetation consistently results in higher power spectral densities of the streamwise turbulence in the residential area than downstream vegetation. While small-scale spanwise velocity fluctuations are found to be comparably energetic at the building's windward side for upstream vegetation, the power becomes substantially concentrated on large-scale eddies in the building wake region, providing specific insights into modulating turbulent eddy motions within the residential zone.}},

  abstract = {{Turbulent flow and boundary-layer (BL) characteristics over cylindrical obstacles have been understudied compared to the flow dynamics around cubic roughness in the urban BL literature. Using large-eddy simulation, we investigate a turbulent BL flow developed over two vertically oriented cylindrical obstacles aligned downstream. For widely separated cylinders, the wake flow undergoes periodic oscillations akin to vortex shedding behind an isolated cylinder. As the height-to-width aspect ratio (AR) of the canyon bounded by the cylinders increases, the streamline geometry exhibits a clear transition from isolated to wake interference and skimming regimes. Two-point autocorrelation functions of velocities confirm a strong coupling of canyon flow with the roughness sublayer for wider canyons, while with evident decoupling as the canyon narrows. The length scales, which measure the spatial correlation in the flow, decrease in both lateral and vertical directions with increasing AR. Turbulent kinetic energy and momentum fluxes below the roughness sublayer present pronounced monotonic scaling with AR (with R-squared values up to 0.84 and 0.98, respectively), resulting in a consistent variation in the surface roughness aerodynamic parameters, the roughness length (z0) and zero-plane displacement (d), with AR. Quantitative differences in the results with respect to those well-established for street canyons are analyzed, with the similarities highlighted. The results offer insights into boundary-layer flow parameterization concerning cylinder-occupied surface roughness.}},

In both sunny and cloudy scenarios, the AW setup ensures a more favourable thermal environment, well aligned with the power spectral analysis indicating enhanced thermal energy capture. The time-lagged cross correlation highlights solar radiation as the primary driver of SG internal thermal variability, with outdoor temperature being of secondary relevance.

This work establishes a 3D coupled model that incorporates electromagnetic, thermochemical, and fluid dynamics effects employing multiphysics modeling methodology. The thermochemical characteristics of an oil shale sample under microwave irradiation are quantified for a broad range of waveguide port positions, specified via Latin hypercube sampling, which ensures the randomness of the port coordinates. The cavity field strength exhibits markedly high sensitivity to the waveguide positioning: the standard deviation of the cavity-averaged electromagnetic intensities for all considered positions is found to be 30.42\% greater compare to the associated mean. The best port position yields a temperature rising rate an order of magnitude higher than the worst positioning, for which kerogen pyrolysis does not appear to be even activated in the same initial stage. The ranking of waveguide positions identified based on the temperature rising rate aligns well with the analysis of microwave utilization efficiency. The study offers insights for optimized microwave reactor design with enhanced oil shale thermal treatment.},

  abstract = {Industrial gases must undergo purification to meet discharge or product standards. While the internal trays of a scrubber tower (ST) are often geometrically complex, it is possible that a simpler design with improved permeability could achieve satisfactory washing performance. Herein, the downward-flowing washing liquid and upward-rising gas inside a simplified ST, built based on the ST equipment of a Shale Oil Refinery factory, was evaluated for different tray arrangements: α=15°, 30° and 45°, where α measures the misalignment between the angle steel strips of neighboring tray layers. The initial high velocity variance present in the lower part of the tower rapidly decreases as the gas ascends across the trays, markedly for the 45° alignment, revealing an enhanced mixing of the gas with the washing liquid. Slightly below the gas outlet, the mean pressure and temperature for the 45° configuration were found to be 14\% and 10K lower, respectively, than the α=15° setup, implying that the former allows a more intensified gas–liquid heat exchange and ensures a more preferable gas pressure for discharge. The insights gained from these findings are anticipated to provide valuable guidance for streamlining the tray design without compromising the desired gas purification performance.},

Using large-eddy simulation (LES) with virtual walkers implemented, this study investigates pollutant exposure of walking agents (or moving receptors) in an urban turbulent boundary-layer flow developed over an aligned building array under the influence of different wind directions. The spatial variability of the exposure risks are found to be better captured by the moving receptors than the fixed receptors along the same agent walking tracks. We demonstrate that the actual exposure can differ significantly from results interpreted from data recorded by the fixed receptors (corresponding to Eulerian estimates) and show that large discrepancies occur in avenues near the source, wherein dispersion of the point release has not occurred on larger spatiotemporal scales. In most scenarios, optimal evacuation routes are shown to be ones that deviate as much as possible from the dominant wind direction; however, one needs to decide the priority of moving to further avenues first or immediately adjusting the walking direction. The results should serve as a useful baseline reference for environmental health impact assessment and evacuation route planning against hazardous releases of air pollutants in more complex urban environments.},

  abstract = {Pollutant exposure in the urban air quality literature has been typically interpreted from data for fixed locations, which provides an incomplete picture of exposure for pedestrians (or moving receptors). The current study proposes a simple model to parameterise the exposure time for a virtual walker to cross a pollutant cloud during its sweeping downstream across the avenue. The parameterisation, which depends on the centre-of-mass translation and the cloud size, shows satisfactory performance in areas away from the outlet, whence a substantial portion of the pollutants is removed from the control domain and a well-defined centre of mass geometrically vanishes. Applying the tracer age diagnostics, the occurrence time of first exposure for the moving receptors is quantified with no particular caution required for the outlet region. The mean tracer age recorded by the virtual walkers is shown to be up to 25\%–75\% smaller than conventional spatial averages, implying earlier exposure to the pollutants and hence a reference timescale relying on the latter may lead to delayed emergency response. Evacuation route prioritisation based on virtual walker measurements coincides with that indicated by the parameterisation, suggesting the potential usefulness of the model for exposure risk evaluation against atmospheric air pollution incidents.},

  abstract = {Ventilation has shown strong sensitivity to urban geometrical heterogeneity; however, the quantitative connection with the urban morphometric indices, e.g. the packing densities (λf and λp for the frontal and plan area, respectively) and the building-height variability (σH), remains unclear. Using large-eddy simulation (LES), the dispersion of a pollutant scalar is investigated for turbulent boundary-layer (TBL) flows developed over real urban regions. While the time history of the domain averaged concentrations follow the familiar exponentially decaying function for all cases, the decay rates differ and there is a clear monotonic dependence on λf. The mean tracer age, τa, exhibits a strong linear scaling with λf as well (R2=0.8); however, an unambiguous relationship is hard to be discerned for the ventilation timescales versus the other morphometric indices (e.g. λp and σH). An effective canyon aspect ratio (AReff) is proposed for real urban districts, which allows ventilation to be quantified in a simpler manner as that for idealised canyons. The age spectrum, which measures the probability density function of tracer ages across multiple timescales, is analysed to reveal the mechanisms underlying the well-defined connection between ventilation and λf. Results are compared with that for an aligned building array of an equivalent canyon aspect ratio to AReff. The departures reflect the nonlinear effects that are not captured in idealised urban topography setups. The results could be useful for the parameterisation of ventilation in urban areas of complex geometrical profiles and may serve as a reference for urban layout design towards optimum active ventilation capability.},

The influence of an elevated walkway on turbulent flow and dispersion inside a street canyon is investigated numerically with large-eddy simulation (LES). Different walkway designs and elevations are examined for a unit-aspect-ratio street canyon and an external wind perpendicular to the canyon axis. In place of a principal vortex extending through the canyon, smaller primary vortices appear above the walkway lid or below the walkway deck, in accord with the effective aspect ratio of the upper and lower regions. The mean flow decelerates below the deck and the turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) increases around the walkway structure for all configurations. Ventilation mechanisms for a pollutant emitted by a ground-level area source are qualitatively altered. Consequently mean concentrations at the pedestrian and walkway levels may increase by up to 20\% and 30\%, respectively. The velocity and pollutant statistics show a complicated dependence on the walkway design; this dependence is determined in part by interactions between the mean flow and turbulence.},

The turbulent kinetic energy, magnitude of the turbulent shear stress and mean streamwise flow speed show a sharp transition at Rb=0. Quadrant analysis, in particular the fractional stress ratio, indicates that small fluctuations are generated most effectively by neutral flow and large ones by unstable flow. Identical-twin experiments confirm that the effects of stratification are large (pointwise errors in the relative kinetic energy are up to a factor of 10 larger for unstable flow).

The key processes of ventilation and mixing are analysed with the canyon-averaged concentration, mean tracer age and variance. The results are sensitive to the source location and can be classified according to the streamline geometry. The canyon-averaged concentrations for the corner vortices, vortex sea and central vortex do not converge to the same value at large times, though the mean decay rates do. The variance measured with respect to the canyon average shows two distinct decay regimes: the early regime reflects large-scale straining and enhanced diffusion across streamlines, while the late regime is associated with escape from the canyon, i.e., ventilation. Analytical predictions for the variance-decay or mixing time scales are verified for the early regime. It is argued that the presence of an open boundary at the roof level suppresses rapid mixing of the scalar field and is responsible for differences with respect to scalar dynamics within closed domains.},

  Abstract                 = {Urban flow and turbulence are driven by atmospheric flows with larger horizontal scales. Since building-resolving computational fluid dynamics models typically employ steady Dirichlet boundary conditions or forcing, the accuracy of numerical simulations may be limited by the neglect of perturbations. We investigate the sensitivity of flow within a unit-aspect-ratio street canyon to time-dependent perturbations near the inflow boundary. Using large-eddy simulation, time-periodic perturbations to the streamwise velocity component are incorporated via the nudging technique. Spatial averages of pointwise differences between unperturbed and perturbed velocity fields (i.e., the error kinetic energy) show a clear dependence on the perturbation period, though spatial structures are largely insensitive to the time-dependent forcing. The response of the error kinetic energy is maximized for perturbation periods comparable to the time scale of the mean canyon circulation. Frequency spectra indicate that this behaviour arises from a resonance between the inflow forcing and the mean motion around closed streamlines.
